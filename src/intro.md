# Philosophical Discourses between a Lion and a Lamb

This is a series of short philosophical discourses I wrote as the whims took
me. I hope no one will mistakenly take them for a true retelling of an
historical event. If, however, you do, I wish you luck.

Also, new chapters might appear if the whims take me again. Who knows!
