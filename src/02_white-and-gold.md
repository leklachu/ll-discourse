# 2. Why am I White and you are Gold?

"Mother," the little sheepling asked one day, "why am I white and you are gold?"

"Because the good Creator made us that way, dear."

The lioness thought for a while, and like all mothers who want to appear wise before their child, added an explanation. "Perhaps you are white because you are innocent; you do not eat flesh, and the only roots you tear up are the little green ones the Creator has made to flourish and regrow like the grass."

"They are grass, mama!"

"--and I am gold because I am majestic, queen over the wild; all fear before me."

"But cannot innocence rule over the wild, or majesty walk in peace and tranquility, maman?-- may I call you maman?"

"All right, run along now my little mouflon. How could majesty be humble, or innocence full of splendour? It quite boggles the mind."
