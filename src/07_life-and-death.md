# 7. Life, Death and Corruption

That the lamb was different in appearance to his mother -- small, white and fluffy to sleek, golden and terrifying -- was obvious to him. But as the days went on, he felt he was a lion neither inside his sheep's clothing; and if not a lion, could he truly follow his mother's ways?

So one day he asked his mother. "How do I know the right thing to do?"

"Do you have a choice," his mother asked?

"I think so," he offered.

"Then you must do whatever your creator made you to do. Otherwise you are corrupted, and in the end will die."

The lamb pondered this a while. "Then, it seems I am corrupted against my will. For whatever I do, someday I will die."

"So it seems, and I too," answered his mother sadly.

After a pause the lamb spoke again. "Do you think, perhaps, there might be a way to be un-corrupted?"

"That seems very hard," his mother replied, "but if there is, since in life you are corrupted, I can't think it would be possible except through death."
