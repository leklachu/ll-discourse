# 6. A Mother's Love

The sun glinted on the stream, as a mismatched pair wandered through the trees at the water's edge to find a drink, and new thoughts tinkled through the young one's mind.

"Mama, why do you eat other sheep, but not me?"

"I cannot love all sheep," the older answered without missing a step, " it's too much for a simple lion heart. Only the Creator can do that, and besides, he's given me the sheep to eat."

"I hope you won't do that forever!" the younger interjected.

"Well, maybe. But the good Creator given us each a few to love, so we can understand his love too."

"But don't you want to love a little lion, of your own blood, born from your own womb?"

"You and I aren't so different," the mother said. "Sometimes a lion kills a lion - I'm not saying it's right, but it happens. But when we are given someone to love, whoever they be, we must love them with all we have - and the good Creator has given me you. If it were not so, how would the Creator himself love anyone but..." and here the lioness tailed off, for such mysteries must wait their time.
