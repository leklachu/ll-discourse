# 4. Am I Made to Kill?

The lioness and the lamb were watching one day from a hilltop. She, lying gently in the soft grass; he, pulling the same up in big mouthfuls, savouring its juicy taste; and on the hill opposite, their object of interest, a huge flock of whites and browns, making the most of the distance to graze in peace.

A smile flickered across the the lioness's mouth, and a tongue across her muzzle. "Twenty-four, thirty-six, and plump and juicy too."

"Don't talk that way," pleaded the sheep. "Those are my sisters."

"What, all of them?"

"And my cousins, and my aunts." The sheep made a mental note of which ones might best be picked off, if his mother must find a victim.

But the lioness's mind was elsewhere. "Do you think," she asked, half to herself, "this is just how it is? Did the good Creator make me to eat and you to be eaten?"

"Well," answered the lamb, half to the tuft of grass in his mouth, "as a lion you always choose what you want best, right? And if you can't have it you fight for it. Perhaps it wasn't always this way, and one day a lion fought with a sheep and discovered the taste for blood."

"But look at my teeth," mused the mother. "And if I eat grass only I'll die. If that's true, the first lion who chose to eat meat instead must have been quite different. Could we change that much?"

"I think the real question," answered the mouthful of grass, "is whether you can still choose?"
