# 3. The Herd Mentality

The lioness kept her little charge from the pride for some time, but at last she had to exhibit her secret. Before the introduction, she made quite sure to lecture him on how to behave in the pride.

"Now, dear, you must remember to hold your head high and be strong, and flash those little white teeth of yours if someone pushes you around."

"Yes, mother," came the little reply, "but if I push him and he pushes me, where will we end up?"

"When you sheep are all together, you have no sense. You all follow, and who will choose what is best?"

"But what if I choose what is worse? In the herd, we believe in each other, so we stick together even if one is weak - or stupid. We grow strong together. In the pride, what will I do if I am weaker and no one helps me?"

"And in the herd, what do you do if someone pushes you around?"

"Then I am patient. Better to stick together than destroy each other."

"In the pride," explained the mother, "the one who is strongest leads, and he must prove his worth and the others will follow - or leave. We grow strong in the strongest."

"And if one day the fool is strong?"

"Then we will fight him, so the wise may be stronger."

This seemed puzzling to the sheep. At last he had a thought. "Cannot the good Creator, who taught the pride to command, teach a lion to listen to those weaker than him?"

"And," responded the lioness, "cannot the good Creator, who taught the herd to listen, teach a sheep to command?"
