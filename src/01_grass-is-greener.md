# 1. Grass is Greener than Blood

The lioness stole two kills that day, one from mother nature, and another, a large rodent from an eagle who carelessly chose to eat its meal in plain view - for the lamb could hardly be expected to eat its own kin.

But the lamb would not eat, so the lioness took her fill and left the rest to the poor.

"Then what will you eat?" asked the anxious foster mother.

"You see that green stuff over yonder," replied the sheep, "where the ground is smooth and the moisture seeps through the soil; we call that grass. If you'll let me wander over there, I'll eat it. I'm quite old enough not to need milk any more."

"Yes, dear, I know what grass is. But we lie on it, we do not eat it. Why, you'd have to eat over a whole mountainside every day to get your fill."

"But that's exactly what we do, mother - may I call you mother? We get up, we have our morning milk - though I don't, because I'm a big kid now--"

"Not a kid, dear, they taste different--"

"--and we eat, and walk, and walk, and eat. It's not a bad life."

"But," responded the curious mother, "flesh and blood are rich with vitimins and iron, for the hungry cub. If you eat well you can spend a week playing  before your mama must hunt again.

"But mama - may I call you mama? Grazing grass is honourable work, and maybe one doesn't need to play all week, if the Creator has already made the grass to grow and we can eat it?"

"That's enough, little one," the lioness concluded. "Go and eat your grass, if that's what little lambs like best, and I will watch you wherever you wander even if my poor aching legs break for lack of rest."
