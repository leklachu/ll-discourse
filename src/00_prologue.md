# Prologue

The sun shone red up the valley, lighting the higher treetops from beneath with its glow - and here and there between them a swish of a tail and the flash of passing whiskers, gold on golden, as the morning sun climbed up the valley to watch nature's adventures. Down by the stream a flock of wild sheep drank in icy water together with the new-born sunlight, and as a beam hit gold between the trees, in an instant they were gone. Scattering over the rocks and up cliffs, dots and streams of white and grey, but one large boulder slipped under the excitement, and at its rest, the earthly remains of a hard-working mother.

The lioness crouched by its breakfast, eagerly filling its stomach. And as it settled to lazy munches - as the dust settled too - the late ewe's progeny twitched nervously by the rock, pinned in a corner by the latest benefactor of its mother's hard work. With nowhere to run to, no cousins to chase or ancestors to guide, the little orphan did what has been seen on rare occasions in nature, and sidled gently up to the lioness and nuzzled her expensive coat. Hunger satisfied, something twigged in the other's instinct. She, a mother bereft of child; he, a child bereft of mother; and soon the two were walking side by side, a whining little cling-on, and a new mother wondering what on earth to feed the little ball of white fluff.
